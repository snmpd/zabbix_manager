- `eventids`: Return only problems with the given IDs.
- `groupids`: Return only problems created by objects that belong to the given
  host groups.
- `hostids`: Return only problems created by objects that belong to the given
  hosts.
- `objectids`: Return only problems created by the given objects.
- `applicationids`: Return only problems created by objects that belong to the

  ID.
